                            "content": "Okay, let's see what's going on here. So there are these input matrices and outputs, and I need to figure out the pattern to apply to the test input. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input is a 15x15 grid filled with 9s except for one 0 in the third row, 13th column (since indexes start at 0 maybe?), and the output is a 3x3 grid. The output matrix has a 0 in the top left, then 9s around it. Wait, the output's first row is [9,9,0], second is [9,9,9], third [9,9,9]. Wait, maybe the output is taking some key points from the input?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there are two 0s: one in the third row first column (0,0 maybe?), and another in the eighth row's eighth column (so position [7][7] perhaps since rows and columns start at 0). The output here is a 3x3 matrix with the first row [0,8,8], second [8,0,8], third [8,8,8]. That looks like the center is 0, but arranged in a way. Hmm.\n\nIn Example 2's input, there are three 0s it seems. Wait, the third row has a 0 at column 3 and another in column 11? Then an additional 0 in the 10th row, first column. The output here is [[0,7,0],[0,7,7],[7,7,7]]. So that's a bit more complex, because three zeros. But how does that translate to the output?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each position corresponds to certain key points in the original grid. Like, maybe the centers of the quadrants or something? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the first example: The input has a 0 at (2,12) (assuming 0-based). The output is 3x3. The output's [0][2] is 0. So maybe each element in the output grid corresponds to the central values of each quadrant? Wait, but how would that map?\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the center three rows and three columns? The input matrix is 15x15, so the center rows would be rows 7, 8, 9 and columns same, but taking the central 3x3? Wait, 15 elements, so middle is index 7 (since 15//2=7.5, so 7). So rows 7-8-9 maybe?\n\nWait let's see for Example 0. The input has a zero at row 2, column 12. The 3x3 output would be the central 3x3 area? Wait no, because in Example0's output, the 0 is not in the center. The output of Example0's first row has a 0 at the end. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the three central rows and three central columns? Wait, the first input's non-zero cell is mostly 9s except the third row's 13th element (so index 12 in 0-based). But the output's first row is [9,9,0], second and third all 9s. So maybe the output is taking the three central columns from the middle rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a downscaled version where each cell in the output represents a block in the original? Like dividing the 15x15 into 5x5 blocks? Then taking one element from each? But 15 divided by 3 is 5, so maybe 5x5 blocks, then selecting certain points?\n\nWait, maybe each output cell is the value from the original at specific positions. For instance, row positions at 4, 7, 10, and similar for columns?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output's dimensions: inputs are 15x15, outputs are 3x3. So each output cell is a 5x5 block in the original. Then for each 5x5 block, take a single value, perhaps the center?\n\nLet me test that idea. For example0, which has a 0 at row 2 (third row), column 12 (the 13th). In a 15x15 grid divided into 5x5 blocks, how many blocks? 15/5=3, so 3 rows and 3 columns of blocks. Each block is 5x5. The 0 is located in the first block (row 0-4, column 10-14 maybe?), but actually the blocks would be rows 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, so three rows of blocks. Similarly columns same. The 0 in row 2 (within first row's block 0-4), column 12 (which is in column block 3rd column's first block? Wait columns divided as 0-4,5-9,10-14. Column 12 is in the third column block (10\u201314). So the block for row 0-4 and column 10-14. Then the center of that block is at row (0+2)=2, column 12 (which is exactly where the 0 is). So taking the center of each 5x5 block would give the output value. For the first block (top-left block would be first row, first column, but its center is (2,2) so 3rd row 3rd column. Wait but in that example, in the first block (row 0-4, column0-4) the value there would be 9. But in the output's top-left cell, it is 9. Wait the first output cell is [9,9,0]. Hmm, maybe the first row of the output corresponds to the first row of the blocks (first two columns? Not sure now).\n\nWait let me think again. Each of the 3x3 output elements may correspond to each of the 5x5 blocks. Let's see:\n\nThe center of each 5x5 block would be at ( (block_row*5 + 2), (block_col*5 +2) ). For example, first first block (block_row=0, block_col=0) has center at row 2, column 2. The second block in row0, column1 (block_col=1) would have center at row 2, column 7 (5+2=7?), wait maybe columns are divided as 0-4, 5-9, 10-14. So for block_col=2 (third column block), columns are 10-14. The center column would be (10+12)/2 rounded to 12? (10+ ((4)/2) \u2192 10+2=12). So for the third block in row0? Let me see:\n\nThus for block_row and block_col from 0-2 each, the center position for each is (block_row*5 +2, block_col*5 +2). So for each block (i,j), the center is at (2+5*i, 2+5*j). Wait no. Wait:\n\nFor block_row=0 (rows 0-4), block_row*5=0, plus 2: so row 2.\n\nblock_row=1 (rows5-9) \u21925+2=7.\n\nblock_row=2 (rows 10-14) \u219210+2=12.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nThus, the center points are:\n\n(2, 2), (2,7), (2,12)\n\n(7,2), (7,7), (7,12)\n\n(12,2), (12,7), (12,12)\n\nIn Example0's input, the only zero is at (2,12). Let's see where that zeros are in the output:\n\nThe center points:\n\nSo for block (0,0) (i=0,j=0):\n\nthe center is (2,2). The value is 9, so output[0][0] is 9.\n\nFor block (0,1): (2,7) \u2192 9 (since all that row in the input is 9 except the 12th column).\n\n(0,2): (2,12) \u2192 which is 0. So output first row's last element (since j=2 would be the third column) is 0. That matches the first row [9,9,0].\n\nThen second row of the output would come from the centers of the blocks in the middle row (block_row=1):\n\nblock (1,0): (7,2) \u2192 value 9, so output[1][0] 9.\n\n(1,1): (7,7) \u2192 value 9, so middle of row 2 is 9.\n\n(1,2): (7,12) \u2192 the input at (7,12): row7 in input is all 9s except row2, so row7's 12th column is 9. So the second row of output is [9,9,9].\n\nThird row of output: centers at block_row=2.\n\nblock (2,0): (12, 2) \u2192 row12, which in the original is all 9s. Value 9.\n\n(2,1): (12,7) \u2192 9.\n\n(2,2): (12,12) \u2192 row12 in input's columns at 12: the row12 is all 9s except row2. Wait original input for example0's third row (index2) has a 0, but row12 (index12) was all 9's except maybe another point. Wait in example0's input, only the third row (row2) had a zero at column12. So row12's column12's value is 9, making the third row of output [9,9,9]. That matches the first example's output.\n\nSo this seems to work for example0. Let me check example1.\n\nExample1's input has two zeros:\n\nFirst zero is at row2 (since the input's third row is [8, 0, 8...]). Wait let's check:\n\nInput1's first row (index0) is all 8s. Second row (index1) first element is 8, then 0. Wait row2's first element is 0.\n\nSo row2 has a zero at column0 (index0). Another zero is in row7's column7 (from input: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8...]\n\nSo centers:\n\nFirst block (0,0): (2,2) \u2192 row2, column2. In that row2's first elements are 8,0,8, so column2 is 8. So output[0][0] is 8?\n\nWait example1's output is [[0,8,8],[8,0,8],[8,8,8]]. Wait so first element in the output's first row is 0, but according to the above block (0,0)'s center (2,2) is 8 in input.\n\nHmm conflict here. So maybe my initial idea is wrong. Let me check the first example's output again.\n\nWait in Example 1's output, the first row is [0,8,8]. Wait according to the center calculation for block (0,0) is (row2, column2). The input's row at 2 has the first column as 0, but column2 is 8? Because the third element (index2) of row2 (third row) would be column2 which is 8 (since row2 is [8,0,8,8,...]. The third element is the third column, so index2 is 8.\n\nSo the center is 8, so why the output first cell is 0? Hmm.\n\nWait maybe I got the blocks wrong. Let me re-express:\n\nWait the Input1's first 0 is at (row 2, column 0), and the second 0 is at (row7, column7).\n\nThe output of example1 is [[0,8,8],[8,0,8],[8,8,8]]. Let me see each block's centers.\n\nThe first block (i=0, j=0):\n\nRow 2, column 2: value here is 8 (as above).\n\nBut the first output element is 0 here. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm so that suggests my block center approach was incorrect. Maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternative thought: Maybe the output is the minimal values in certain regions. For example, in each of the 3x3 blocks (dividing the 15 into 5x5 regions? Not sure.\n\nWait example0's output has a 0 in its first row third column because that's where the 0 was in the input. The rest are 9s.\n\nExample1's first row starts with 0. The first block area (top left) might have a minimum value of 0 because there's a zero in that block.\n\nAh! Maybe each output cell holds the minimal value in the corresponding 5x5 block?\n\nWait let's test that:\n\nFor Example1:\n\nThe first block (i=0, j=0) is the top-left 5x5 area.\n\nIn this block (rows0-4, columns0-4), there's a 0 at row2, column0, so the minimum there is 0. That would set the first output cell as 0, which matches example1's first output [0, ...].\n\nThe second column (j=1 for block (0,1) would be columns5-9, rows0-4. In that area, the min is 8 (since all are 8, the input in that region except maybe the third row? Third row (row2) has column0 as 0 but the others in columns1 and beyond are 8. So min is 8, so the next element is 8.\n\nThird block of first row (j=2) is rows0-4, columns10-14: all are 8 except maybe none of the zeros are there. So min is 8. Wait but the first row third element in output is 8 yes. So that would fit.\n\nMoving to output's second row, first element: block (row1, column0) is (rows5-9, columns0-4).\n\nLooking at input's row7 (row7 is the 8th row) has a zero at column7, but that's in a different column block. The rows5-9, columns0-4 may not have any zeros. The first zero in row2 is in first columns but that's in block (row0, col0). The other zero in row7 is in columns7, in block (row1, col1). So block (row1, col0) has minimum 8, so output[1][0] is 8. But the output here has the second row first element as 8 which matches.\n\nThen the center block (row1, col1) would be rows5-9, columns5-9. The zero is at row7, column7 (which is in this block). So min is 0 here, so output[1][1] is 0. Which matches the example's second row middle element 0.\n\nThird element of second row: block (row1, col2) (columns10-14 in that row area). No zeros there. So min is 8.\n\nThird row of output is for block row2 (row10-14). The first block here (col0) rows10-14, columns0-4. Let's see input in those rows. The input for rows10-14 are all 8's, so min is 8. So that's the first element of third row.\n\nMiddle of third row is block (row2, col1). Columns5-9, rows 10-14: all 8's? Because the other zeros are elsewhere, and in those rows (like row12?), no. The other zero in input1 is at row7 (within row1's blocks) So this block has min 8. Thus output third row second element is 8. Last element for third row: columns10-14, rows10-14. There is a zero in row7 which is outside? Wait row12 (in third row blocks: row12 is within rows10-14). Wait any zeros here? Looking at input example1's test, the second zero is at row7, col7. The other zeros in input1 are only those two. So the block row2 (third row in blocks) and column2 would have min 8. So the third row of output would be [8,8,8], which matches.\n\nSo Example1's output [[0,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]] fits with taking the minimum of each 5x5 block.\n\nTesting example0: the only 0 is in the first row's third column block. The min for that block is 0, so the first row, third element (output's first row third column) is 0, the rest are 9's.\n\nThe second and third output rows all 9's because their respective blocks have all 9's except the first block (which was the only one with a 0). Wait, in example0's case, the second row's blocks are in row5-9 and row10-14. But their min would still be 9 unless there were any 0s there.\n\nYes. So this pattern explains the examples. So the transformation is, for each 5x5 block (divided into 3x3 blocks of 5x5 each?), take the minimum value as the output cell. Since the input are all 9's and 8's with zeros, the min picks up the zeros when present.\n\nSo applying this to the Test Input:\n\nThe test input is a 15x15 grid of 6's, except for some 0s. The input given is:\n\nTest Input:\n[[6,6,6,6,6,0,6... (row0)\n[6,6,6,6,6,0,6, etc... row1 but looking at the exact input...]\n\nWait let me parse the test input properly.\n\nTest input rows (15 rows, each has 15 elements):\n\nLooking at first few rows:\n\nFirst row: [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]\n\nSecond row: [6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]\n\nThird row: [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]\n\nThen most rows are all 6 except for the second row and then in the 12th row?\n\nWait let me check the test input line by line:\n\nTest Input as written:\n\nFirst line:\n\n[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6] \u2192 all 6's. (Row 0)\n\nSecond line (row1):\n\n[6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6] \u2192 the 6th element (index5) is 0.\n\nThird row (row2):\n\n[6 all elements? yes it's all 6. \n\nThen rows 3-8 (rows3 to 7):\n\nAll rows 3,4,5,6,7,8: all 6's except maybe none. \n\nRow 9 (index9) also all 6?\n\nWait next line:\n\nRow 13 (index12? let me count. Let's see the test input's 15 rows.\n\nThe test input lists 15 rows, each is a list. Let me count the rows given:\n\nAfter the first line (row0):\n\nThen:\n1. row1: [6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]\n2. row2: all 6's\n3. row3: all 6's\n4. row4: all6\n5. row5: all6\n6. row6: all6\n7. row7: all6\n8. row8: all6\n9. row9: all6\n10. row10: yes\n11. row11: the 12th row (11? Wait no, up to now row1 is first, then row2,... row14 is last.\n\nLooking further:\n\nThe 14th row in the test input is the 14th element. In the test input's lines, the 14th line (if counting from first as row0) would be the line starting with:\n\n[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,6]\n\nThat's the 13th row (index13?). Because the row starting with 6,6,6..., last but one elements. The 0 here is in column13 (index13), so row13 and column13? Let's confirm. The line is:\n\n[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,6]\n\nIndex13 is the second last element, yes, so row 13 (since that row is the 14th row if starting from 0, or the 13th index).\n\nSo the zeros in test input are at (row1, column5) and (row13, column13). So two 0s.\n\nSo applying the rule where each 3x3 cell is the minimum of a 5x5 block.\n\nEach output cell corresponds to a block:\n\nThe blocks are divided as follows:\n\nRows divided into 0-4 (first block_row0), 5-9 (block_row1), 10-14 (block_row2).\n\nSame for columns: first block (columns0-4), second (5-9), third (10-14).\n\nSo, for each block (block_row, block_col):\n\nCompute the min in the 5x5 submatrix starting at (block_row*5, block_col*5) up to (block_row*5+4, block_col*5+4).\n\nNow let's find the min for each block.\n\nFirst block (row0, col0): rows0-4, columns0-4.\n\nIn these rows:\n\nRow0: all6.\n\nRow1 (part of this block since block_row0 includes row0-4, so row1 is here.\n\nRow1 has an element at column5, which is outside this column block (columns0-4). The first block's columns are 0-4, so that zero in row1 is column5, which is not in this block's columns (columns 0-4). Thus the min is 6.\n\nThus first cell of output is 6?\n\nWait wait: the zero at row1 is at column5: which is in the second column block. So in block_row0, block_col1 (columns5-9). So, block (0,1):\n\n rows0-4, columns5-9.\n\nHere, the input's row0 to row4 in columns5-9:\n\nRow0: at column5 (index5) in row0 is 6.\n\nRow1's column5 is 0 (this is the zero in row1). Thus the min here is 0.\n\nThus block (0,1) has a min of 0.\n\nWait let me go block by block:\n\nFirst row of outputs (block_row0):\n\nColumn0's block (block_col0):\n\nblock is rows0-4, col0-4: no zeros here, min 6. \u2192 first cell (0,0) 6.\n\nColumn1 (block_col1):\n\nrows0-4, columns5-9.\n\nThe row1 here has a 0 at column5 (since row1's column5 is the sixth column (starting at 0), so yes. So the min here is 0. \u2192 (0,1) is 0.\n\nColumn2 (block_col2):\n\ncolumns10-14 in block_row0 (rows0-4):\n\nIn those columns, are there any 0? The first 5 rows have all 6 except maybe row1's column5 (but that is block_col1's area). So block_col2 in rows0-4: columns10-14. In row1 (which row1 is in row0 block_row), columns10-14 are 6. So the minimum here is 6. Thus (0,2) is 6.\n\nThus first row of output: [6,0,6].\n\nSecond row (block_row1):\n\nThis covers rows5-9.\n\nFirst column (block_col0, columns0-4):\n\nLooking in rows5-9, columns0-4:\n\nAll of these rows (rows5-9) are all 6's except the row1 is up there. So no 0 here. Min is6.\n\nblock_col1 (columns5-9 in rows5-9):\n\nThe zeros? The only zeros in block_row1 are?\n\nThe other zero is in row13 and column13, which is in block_row2.\n\nThus in block_row1 (rows5-9) and any column block except maybe none?\n\nThus block_col1 of row1 (so rows5-9 and columns5-9) has min 6.\n\nblock_col2 of row1 (columns10-14): Similarly all 6's. So first element (row1, column0 block) cell is 6, (row1, col1)=6, (row1, col2)=6. Wait, but the second row of the output?\n\nWait let's do the second row.\n\nSecond output row (block_row1):\n\nblock_col0: rows5-9, column0-4: min 6.\n\nblock_col1: rows5-9, columns5-9: since none of the zeros are here, min6.\n\nblock_col2: columns10-14 in rows5-9, also all6. So second row: [6,6,6].\n\nThird row (block_row2): rows10-14.\n\nblock_col0 (columns0-4): \n\nChecking rows 10-14, columns0-4:\n\nAll 6's (since the zeros are at row1 (which is in row0 block_row) and row13, column13.\n\nRow13 is part of block_row2 (since it's in rows10\u201314). Row13's column13 is in block_col2 (columns10-14).\n\nIn block_col0 (columns0-4):\n\nrow13, columns0-4 are 6.\n\nSo min is6.\n\nblock_col1 (columns5-9):\n\nIn rows10-14, columns5-9:\n\nCheck rows10-14. All are 6 except row13's column13 which is outside this block_col1's columns (5-9). So min6.\n\nblock_col2: columns10-14, rows10-14:\n\nHere, row13 (which is in the range) has at column13 (which is part of this column block) the zero.\n\nLooking at row13's column13:\n\nSo in columns10-14 (block_col2 columns) in rows10-14 (block_row2):\n\nThe row13 has a 0 at column13. Thus the min here is 0.\n\nTherefore, for the block_col2 at row13, the min is 0.\n\nThus third row of outputs:\n\nblock_row2, columns0: min6,\n\ncolumns1: min6,\n\ncolumns2: min0 (since the zero is present here).\n\nThus third row is [6,6,0].\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nFirst row: [6,0,6]\n\nSecond row: [6,6,6]\n\nThird row: [6,6,0]\n\nWait wait, wait. Third row, third element comes from block_row2 (rows10-14), block_col2 (columns10-14). The zero is in that block.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFinal output should be:\n\n[[6, 0, 6], \n\n[6,6,6],\n\n[6,6,0]]\n\nWait let me double-check:\n\nFirst row of output is:\n\nblock (0,0): min6 \u2192 first element 6,\n\nblock (0,1): 0 \u2192 second element 0,\n\nblock (0,2): min6 \u2192 the third 6.\n\nSecond row:\n\nblock (1,0):6, (1,1):6, (1,2):6 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nThird row:\n\nblock (2,0):6 (since rows10-14's columns0-4 are all 6),\n\nblock (2,1): columns5-9 (rows10-14) \u2192 no zeros \u21926,\n\nblock (2,2): rows10-14, columns10-14. The only zero here is in row13, column13 \u2192 min0.\n\nThus third row is [6,6,0].\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[[6,0,6],[6,6,6],[6,6,0]]\n\nWait but I need to check if the second zero (at row13 and col13):\n\nFor block_row2 (rows10-14), block_col2 (cols10-14). The zero is within this block's area. So yes.\n\nThus the output should be as above. But let me make sure the positions are correctly calculated. \n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in block numbering. Let me confirm the block coordinates again. Each block (i,j) is rows:\n\ni=0 \u2192 rows0 1 2 3 4,\n\ni=1 \u2192 rows5 6 7 8 9,\n\ni=2 \u2192 rows10 11 12 13 14.\n\nSimilarly for the columns. So row13 is in i=2 (block row2).\n\nColumn13 is in columns10-14 (j=2).\n\nSo the zero is indeed in block (2,2).\n\nYes, that's correct. So that third block of the third row's min is 0.\n\nThus the final output matrix is:\n\n[[6,0,6],\n [6,6,6],\n [6,6,0]]\n</think>\n\n[[6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0]]"

                            "content": "Alright, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input is a 15x15 grid filled mostly with 9s except for a single 0 in the third row, 13th position (if we start counting from 0). The output is a 3x3 grid where the first row is [9,9,0], the second [9,9,9], and the third all 9s. Wait, but the output given is [[9,9,0],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]. Hmm. Wait, the input has a 0 in position (2,12) (since rows start at 0). The output seems to take the middle 3x3 section of the input grid?\n\nWait, the input is 15 rows by 15 columns. The center would be around rows 7 and columns 7. But maybe the output is a smaller grid where each cell is the sum or some function of groups in the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents the minimum or zero in certain positions. Alternatively, looking at Example 0's input: the only 0 is at (2,12). The output has a 0 at position (0,2) in the 3x3 output. Hmm. That might not directly correspond.\n\nWait let's check all examples systematically.\n\nExample 0 Input: All 9's except one 0 in row 2, column 12 (third row, thirteenth column). The output's first row third element is 0. The output rows are 3 elements each. So perhaps the output grid is built from the center 3x3 area of the input, but scaled down? Wait the input is 15x15, so the center would be 7,7. The 3x3 center square would be rows 7-8, but maybe rows 6,7,8 and columns 6,7,8? Wait 15 elements: the middle indices are 7 (since 0-14). So center 3x3 would be from row 7\u00b11? So rows 6-8, columns 6-8? Let me see.\n\nRow 2 in the input has the 0 at column 12. But the output's 0 is in position (0,2). Hmm, that's inconsistent.\nAlternatively perhaps the output's 3 rows correspond to the top-left, center, and bottom-right or some such.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are taking every 5th element? Wait 15 elements divided into 3 would mean each part is 5 elements. But the output has 3 elements per row, so each part is 5 elements in the input, then pick the middle element? Not sure.\n\nWait let's compare Input 0 to Output:\n\nInput grid has a 0 at (row 2, column 12). The output's first row has 0 at position 2. The first row of output is the positions corresponding to maybe rows?\n\nWait the output is:\n\nRow 0 (of output): [9,9,0]\n\nRow 1: [9,9,9]\n\nRow 2: [9,9,9]\n\nWait maybe the first row of the output corresponds to the top 5 rows of the input (rows 0-4), the second row the middle 5 (5-9?), third the bottom 5? But not sure how they reduce that to a single row. Alternatively, maybe for each of the 3 rows in output, they take e.g. every 5th element, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output: the only zero is in position (0,2). So that might be because in the input, there's a zero in some position that maps to that.\n\nWait let's think differently. The test input has 15 rows and 15 columns. The output is 3x3. Maybe each cell in the output is determined by the corresponding block in the input?\n\nDividing the input into a 3x3 grid of blocks. Since 15 divided by 3 is 5, each block is 5x5. Then, for each block, the output cell is the minimum value in that block or the value at the center of the block.\n\nIn Example 0's Input, every block except the the third block in the first row (since row indices 0-2 as first row of output's blocks?) would have the 0 in the third row (input row 2 is actually part of the first third of the rows? Let me see.\n\nDividing the input into 3 rows of 5 rows each:\n\nFirst part (rows 0-4), middle (5-9), last (10-14).\n\nSimilarly columns divided into 3 parts (cols 0-4,5-9,10-14). So each block is 5x5.\n\nThe 0 in example0 is at row 2 (part 1 rows, i.e., first third), column 12 which is in column part 10-14 (third column block). So the corresponding output block [0][2] would be the 5x5 block in the first row third column block. Since that block contains the 0, which is the minimum, the output here would be 0.\n\nIn the other blocks except that, all are 9, so their min is 9, so output [[9,9,0],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]. That seems to fit.\n\nChecking example1:\n\nInput has two zeros: one at row1 col0? Wait first occurrence:\n\nLooking at the input for example1:\n\nRow 2 has a 0 at position 1 (columns 0 is 8, 1 is 0, etc). Wait:\n\nInput for example1 first three rows:\n\nRow0: all 8s except maybe not\n\nWait row2 has [8, 0, 8,8,...], so the first occurrence's 0 is at (row2, column1).\n\nAnother zero at row7 column7? Let's see example1 input's row7, column7 is 0. \n\nSplit into 3x3 blocks each 5x5. \n\nFirst block (row 0-4, col0-4):\n\nThe 0 in row2 (row is in first half) column1 (first third column), so in the first row-first column output block, the min would be 0. Wait but the output of example1 is [[0,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]].\n\nWait first output row's first element is 0. That corresponds to first row block (rows 0-4), first column block (columns 0-4). The 0 in (2,1) is in this block, so min is 0. So that position would be 0. \n\nThe second element in first output row is the first row block (rows 0-4), second column block (cols5-9). In the input, the second column block in that first row block would contain any zeros? Let's see. In example1's input, except the first zero at row2, column1 (inside first block), the other zero is at row7, column7 (which is in rows5-9 (second row block) and cols5-9 (second column block). So second row and second column block of output would be 0, which is in the (1,1) position of the output, which matches example1's output: the middle element of the second row is 0. The third element of first row would be first row block, third column block (columns 10-14). In the input's first row block (rows0-4), in columns 10-14: the first 0 in the input is at column1 which is first third. Wait the example1's first output row third element is 8. So in first row block, third column block (columns 10-14, rows0-4): there are no zeros there, so min is 8. So that would give 8, which aligns with their output [0,8,8]. Similarly for other blocks.\n\nThis seems to match the pattern. The output grid is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the minimum value in the corresponding 5x5 block of the input. Since the problem examples only have 9 and 8 etc., which are all higher than 0, the only place the min would drop is where there is a 0. \n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input is all 6's except two 0s. Let me look where those 0's are.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nFirst row is all 6s except the sixth element? Wait let's parse the input properly.\n\nThe test input is a list of rows. Let me list out the rows:\n\nRow0: [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6] \u2014 all 6's\n\nRow1: [6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6] \u2192 the 0 is at index 5 (since 0-based) so column5.\n\nRow2: all 6's \n\nRow3 to Row10: all 6's?\n\nRow12: [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,6] \u2192 0 at column13 (index13)\n\nRow13 and 14 are all 6's.\n\nSo the zeros are located:\n\nFirst zero in (row1, column5).\n\nSecond zero in (row12, column13).\n\nNow, we need to divide the 15x15 input into 3x3 blocks, each 5x5.\n\nThe blocks are as follows:\n\nRow blocks: rows 0-4 (block0), 5-9 (block1), 10-14 (block2). Similarly, column blocks are 0-4,5-9,10-14.\n\nSo each cell (i,j) in the output corresponds to the 5x5 block starting at row i*5 and column j*5.\n\nNow, let's check each output cell for the minimum.\n\nFirst row (i=0):\n\nEach of this row's three columns (j=0,1,2):\n\nFirst column block (j=0): columns0-4.\n\nIn row 0 (of output column j=0, row i=0):\n\nThe block is rows0-4 (block0 rows), columns0-4 (block0 columns). Are there any zeros here?\n\nLooking at the test input, the first zero is at (row1, column5). Column5 is in 5-9 (block1 columns), so this block (columns0-4) doesn't include column5. So this first block has no zeros, so min is 6.\n\nSecond column of first row (j=1): columns5-9.\n\nHere, the first zero at (row1, column5) is in this block (columns5-9, rows0-4). So in this block, the minimum is 0.\n\nThird column (j=2 columns10-14):\n\nIn rows0-4 and columns10-14: any zeros? The first row has no zeros beyond column5. Looking at rows0-4: row1 has a 0 at column5 not in this column block (columns10-14 are columns 10-14, so no). Thus min is 6 here.\n\nWait but wait the first output row first element is 6 (not 0) since first block (cols0-4) has no zeros. Second element (columns5-9) has the 0. Third (cols10-14) is 6. So first output row's elements would be [6, 0,6].\n\nSecond row (i=1):\n\nThis corresponds to input rows5-9.\n\nChecking columns:\n\nj=0 (columns0-4):\n\nLooking in rows5-9, columns0-4: any zeros? The zeros are only in row1, which is outside rows5-9. The second zero is at row12, which is in row block2. So in row block1 (rows5-9), no zeros. Min is 6.\n\nj=1 (columns5-9):\n\nIn rows5-9 and columns5-9: any zeros? The first zero was at row1 (not in rows5-9). The second zero is at row12. So no zeros here. However, let me check if any other zeros exist. The test input only has two zeros: row1, col5 and row12, col13. So this column block (columns5-9) in row block1 (5-9 rows) has no zeros, so min 6.\n\nj=2 (columns10-14, same rows5-9):\n\nStill no zeros here (the second zero is at row12). So min is 6. Thus the second row of output is [6, 6,6].\n\nThird row (i=2) corresponds to rows10-14.\n\nThird row's columns:\n\nj=0 (columns0-4):\n\nRows10-14, columns0-4: the second zero is at row12, column13 (which is columns10-14? column13 is in 10-14). Wait:\n\nSecond zero is (row12, 13). So row12 is in rows10-14 (third row block). Column13 is columns10-14 (third column block). So in the third row block and third column block (i=2, j=2), there is a zero. Let's check each:\n\nThird row's first column (j=0):\n\ncolumns0-4 in rows10-14. Any zeros here? No. The second zero is in column13, so no. So min 6.\n\nThird row's second column (j=1: columns5-9): rows10-14 here also no zeros. The second zero is in col13 (third column block). So min is 6.\n\nThird row's third column (j=2): columns10-14, rows10-14. The zero is here (row12, column13). So min is 0.\n\nThus, the third row in the output's third column is 0. So third output row is [6,6,0].\n\nPutting it all together, the output would be:\n\nFirst row: [6 (min 6), 0 (min 0 in that block),6 ]\n\nSecond row: [6,6,6]\n\nThird row: [6,6,0]\n\nWait but wait let me verify again for the position of the second zero's block.\n\nThird row third column (j=2 for columns10-14 and rows10-14):\n\nRows10-14, columns10-14. The zero at row12 (within that rows) and column13 (within those columns). So yes, that block has a 0, so its min is 0.\n\nSecond row, third column (j=2 columns10-14, rows5-9): the second zero is not here, so min is 6.\n\nHence the output matrix would be:\n\nRow0: [6, 0,6]\n\nRow1: [6,6,6]\n\nRow2: [6,6,0]\n\nWait but the output format in examples uses [9] for the first element when there's a non-zero, but looking at the test cases:\n\nWait in example0's output, for instance, the 0 was in the first block's third column (j=2 block's min zero):\n\nSo applying the same, the test input's output would be:\n\n[[6,0,6],[6,6,6],[6,6,0]]\n\nWait in example0, the first row of output is [9,9,0] which corresponded to three column blocks, where the third had the zero, so that third column is 0.\n\nYes, so here, in the first row's second column block had the zero (the first zero in row1 column5 is part of first row, second column block).\n\nSimilarly, third row's third column had the zero (row12, column13).\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\nFirst row: [6, 0, 6]\n\nSecond row: All 6s except nothing since the second block (rows5-9) has no zeros, so all 6.\n\nThird row third column has 0, so [6,6,0]\n\nHence the output matrix would be:\n\n[[6,0,6],[6,6,6],[6,6,0]]\n\nWait but let me confirm all blocks:\n\nRow0 (output first row):\n\nj=0 (columns0-4, rows0-4): No zeros \u2192 6\n\nj=1 (columns5-9 in rows0-4: has the first zero (row1, col5) \u2192 min 0\n\nj=2 (columns10-14, rows0-4): no zeros \u21926 \u2192 so row 0 is [6,0,6]\n\nRow1 (output second row, rows5-9, any zeros? no):\n\nAll their blocks' minimums are 6 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n\nRow2 (output third row, rows10-14, columns div into j0, j1, j2):\n\nj=0 (columns0-4 here): no zeros \u21926\n\nj=1 (columns5-9): no zeros \u21926\n\nj=2 (columns10-14): has the second zero at (row12,13) \u2192 min is 0 \u2192 so row2 is [6,6,0]\n\nYes, so the output should be:\n\n[[6, 0, 6],\n [6, 6, 6],\n[6,6,0]]\n\nSo in the required format, that's:\n\n[[6,0,6],[6,6,6],[6,6,0]]\n</think>\n\n[[6,0,6],[6,6,6],[6,6,0]]"
